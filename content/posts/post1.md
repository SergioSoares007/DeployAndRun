This bitter earth  
Well, what the fruit it bears  
Ooooh  
This bitter earth  
And if my life  
Is like the dust  
Oooh that hides  
The glow of a rose  
What good am I?  
Heaven only knows  

Lord, this bitter earth  
Yes can be so cold  
Today you're young  
Too soon, you're old  
But while a voice  
Within me cries  
I'm sure someone may answer my call  
And this bitter earth, oooh  
May not, oh, be so bitter after all  

This bitter earth  
Lord, this bitter earth  
What good is love  
Mmmm, that no one shares  
And if my life is like the dust  
Oooh that hides, the glow of a rose  
What good am I  
What good am I  
Heaven only knows
