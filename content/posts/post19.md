# 101 Business Applications Developers Should Know (2025 Edition)

Whether you’re building a startup or modernizing an enterprise, your stack isn’t just code—it’s the ecosystem of tools that powers your product, people, and processes. This guide curates 101 essential applications across databases, productivity accelerators, security, networking, analytics, and more. Each entry is concise, developer-focused, and battle-tested in real-world teams.

How to use this list:
- Skim by category to fill gaps in your stack.
- Compare tools that overlap (e.g., CI/CD, BI, CRM) to fit your scale and workflow.
- Look for integration patterns: the best stacks reduce context switching.

## Quick CI/CD Example: Build, Test, and Deploy on Push

A minimal GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests, builds a Docker image, and deploys to Kubernetes. Adjust steps to match your stack.

```yaml
name: CI-CD
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-test-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install deps and test
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm test -- --ci

      - name: Build image
        run: |
          docker build -t ghcr.io/your-org/your-app:${{ github.sha }} .

      - name: Login to GHCR
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Push image
        run: |
          docker push ghcr.io/your-org/your-app:${{ github.sha }}

      - name: Set up kubectl
        uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v4
        with:
          version: 'v1.30.0'

      - name: Deploy
        env:
          IMAGE: ghcr.io/your-org/your-app:${{ github.sha }}
        run: |
          sed -e "s|IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER|$IMAGE|g" k8s/deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

Pro tips:
- Use OpenTelemetry for traces/metrics/logs and forward to Datadog/New Relic/Grafana.
- Store secrets in Vault or your cloud KMS; never in repos.
- Enforce SAST/SCA (Snyk) and DAST (ZAP) in CI, not just pre-release.

## How to Choose the Right Tools for Your Team

- Fit to workflow: Tools should integrate with your primary dev flow (Git provider, chat, ticketing).
- Scale and cost: Prefer consumption or per-seat models that match your growth curve.
- Ecosystem: Strong APIs, webhooks, and connectors reduce glue code and manual work.
- Security posture: SSO/SAML, audit logs, least-privilege roles, and compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001).
- Vendor lock-in: Favor open standards (OpenAPI, OpenTelemetry, Terraform) and exportability.
- Time-to-value: Pilot with a small project; prefer tools that deliver wins in weeks, not quarters.

If you’re assembling a stack today, start with your core production needs (cloud, CI/CD, observability, security) and layer in collaboration and business systems (CRM, analytics, docs) as workflows mature. The best stacks are boring, interoperable, and automate the busywork so your team can ship faster.
