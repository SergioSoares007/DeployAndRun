## The Violin

The violin has been a lifelong companion in my personal journey. Learning to play was not just about music, but about patience, discipline, and emotional expression. Each note is a reflection of countless hours of practice and the joy of creating something beautiful from silence.

## Harley-Davidson Spirit

Riding a Harley-Davidson is more than just transportation – it’s freedom, brotherhood, and the open road. It’s about feeling the wind, hearing the roar of the engine, and knowing that the journey is as important as the destination. It represents independence, adventure, and a spirit that refuses to be tamed.

Football has been a passion of mine since childhood – both playing and watching. I especially follow Sporting Clube de Portugal, a club that represents tradition, resilience, and excellence. The game is more than sport; it’s teamwork, strategy, and pure excitement.

## The Sea and Surf

The sea is my refuge. Whether it’s surfing, swimming, or simply being near the water, the ocean always brings me clarity and peace. Surfing in particular is a perfect balance of challenge and harmony with nature, riding the energy of the waves and feeling fully alive.
